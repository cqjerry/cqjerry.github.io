You made me not sleep much (only 2 hours) throughout the weekend, you made write code on a platform I'm not familiar with (Android and Android Wear) and last but not least, you made me present our project in the most awkwardly way I can. But that's the fun with hackathons. You have an idea and you have x amount of time to make that idea happen.
