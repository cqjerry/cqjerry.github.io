title: "Hack TM 2015. Things could have gone better, much better..."
---

A few days before the event started I was contacted by the HackTM team to be their official blogger for the event. I would have written about the event regardless, but being announced as the official blogger, I feel like it's my responsabilty to tell you that this article is not influenced in any shape or form from the team. The thoughts are my own and.

Good, now that we've gotten than out of the way, time to tell about Hack 2015; the biggest South-Eastern European hackathon.
