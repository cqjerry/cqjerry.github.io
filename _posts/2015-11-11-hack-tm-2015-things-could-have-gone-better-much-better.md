title: "Hack TM 2015. Things could have gone better, much better..."
---


A few days before the event started I was contacted by the HackTM team to be their official blogger for the event. I would have written about the event regardless, but being announced as the official blogger, I feel like it's my responsabilty to tell you that this article is not influenced in any shape or form from the team. The thoughts are my own and.

Good, now that we've gotten than out of the way, time to tell about Hack 2015; the biggest South-Eastern European hackathon.

###The atmosphere

Like I said in the first [post]({% post_url 2015-11-07-hacktm-2015-initial-thoughts %}), it took place in Heaven's Ballroom Tent. Yes, a tent. Not the kind you'd sleep in, no. It was a closed tent. Nobody is crazy enough to host an event like this in an outdoor open tent. The only problem is that the heaters didn't handle the cold of the weekend. The even started out on Friday the 6th of November at 18:00 and held throught the weekend until Sunday the 8th. At firt, when people started registering and gathering at the venue, the temperature wasn't much of a problem. Everybody rushing to find a table to setup their gear, pitching, socializing, you'd barely feel the cold. When we started settling down and actually starting to work is when it hit us.

Programming is not a physically intense activity. You just a the computer typing away. Not much heat is generated. Image doing this in a room about 15-16 for 48 hours. Yeah, it's brutal. To makes matters worse, people started feeling cold/tired and actually starting leaving. That's when the temperature started dropping even lower. I wish I had a thermometer with me to see how cold it was. Probally it was a bit hotter than we image (because that's how our body works), but still. I don't blame the organizers on this one, they couldn't have predicted it.

Food and drinks weren't a problem. The venue included them both (as I was told, could be mistaken about the food, but the drinks were definately provided). Nothing to complain here. On Sunday we had one hot meal (some potatoes, rice and chicken breast in white parmesan sauce - good food in my opinion), on the same evening some appetizers style plateaus (them good too). The following morning we had the same appetizers style plateaus and in the evening, the people at Heaven were kind enough to bake some pizzas. Everybody loves pizza. It was actually quite good. Though I feel that some people had the misfortune to not taste it. I feel sorry for them. Me and my teammate had like 3 slices together. Seconds were impossible to get. They couldn't bake as fast as we ate them. Nonetheless is was good pizza.

###What we made
We tried to make an app that tracks the location of your friends. Not in stalk-y way, but in a helpful one. I've been living in Timisoara for the past 5 years. Alex, my teammate has not. He comes for a visit once in a while, but everytime I gotta send him a Google Maps pin to his phone so he can use his GPS to find his way. What if there's an app that tells you your friends location. Even gives you a notification when you're in a set proximity to him? Wouldn't that be helpful? We thought so, so we built an app that does just that. Or at least tried. At it's core it is a Windows 10 Universal Platform App. That means that it can run on virtually anything, since Windows 10 runs (or will run) on anything. This doesn't has to be an app on your phone. It can be on Windows 10 IoT powered Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately the jury didn't decided that our app was in the top 3 of the Open Track, which segways beatifuly into the next section.
