title: Recreating the Windows Phone Podcasts app as an Universal Windows App (Part II)
---

Recreating the Windows Phone Podcasts app as an Universal Windows App is not that straight forward and easy as one might think. The original plan of recreating it in Windows 8.1 and then port it to Windows 10 is out the window (no pun intended). Why you may ask? A little a while ago I search on [MSDN](http://www.msdn.com) about porting your Windows 8.1 App to Windows 10. I can't find the article, I can find the link, but it appears the content has been removed:

I said that if you have an existing Windows 8.1 app, the easiest way to port the application was to create a Windows 10 app, then import all the assets, code files and such into the new app. I don't have an existing Windows 8.1 app, so I won't go ahead and start recreating in Windows 8.1, just to copy the code to a Windows 10 project. It just doesn't make sense to me. I know I said that we'll be creating a Windows 8.1 app then convert it to Windows 10 one, but that isn't really feasable.
