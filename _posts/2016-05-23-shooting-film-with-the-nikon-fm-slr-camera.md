title: Shooting film with the Nikon FM SLR Camera
---

I had film cameras when I was little, but nothing compares with a SLR film camera. You don't get to see the what you've shot untill you develop the film, but when you the results are pretty nice. Even though it's a 39 year old camera (not sure on the exact manufacturing date on mine, but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FM) says Nikon produced these camera between 1977 and 1982) it has an electronic light meter (powered by a small LR-44 watch battery) and it's in a pretty good condition. There are no light leaks and if the shots are exposed properly, everything looks great and vintage (which is what you can expect while shooting with this type of camera).
