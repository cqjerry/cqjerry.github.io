I recently went to a .NET meetup in my area to present the [MVVM Light][mvvm-light] framework in the context of Universal Windows Platform. You can find the presentation [here][presentation]. After a few introduction points and went into the code, and I've chosen to use the [Podcast Manager][solocast] I'm working on.
