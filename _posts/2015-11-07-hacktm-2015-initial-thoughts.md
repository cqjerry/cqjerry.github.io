title: HackTM 2015 initial thoughts
---

I've waited for HackTM ever since the one last year ended. [Hack TM eHealth]({% post_url 2015-06-29-hack-tm-you-did-it-again %}) was just a taste. It's time for the real deal.

I'm a bit disapointed about the first night. The venue, Heaven Ballrooom, was impressive at first, filled with at least 300 people. Everybody was rushing to get their gear setup. Behind the dozen laptops and wires, you can see a greeting of smiles from the organizers, even though the cold air kind of takes a toll on the atmosphere.
Leaving that behind, the "zone" atmosphere is exactly as expected, the kind of  geek-fest that you see on events like these, which is nice, sine I am a sort of a geek, being among them makes me feel.. at home.
